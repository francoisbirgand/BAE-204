["lifes-secrets-for-capturing-energy.html", "Chapter 2 Life’s secrets for capturing energy 2.1 The five fundamental requirements of life 2.2 Electron allocation onto CHONSP", " Chapter 2 Life’s secrets for capturing energy Much of the environmental and ecological engineering challenges are about dealing with too many suspended sediments and too many nutrients in surface and ground waters, and the consequences of too much organic matter and reduced compounds in aquatic ecosystems. We have also seen that these three challenges are inter-connected and related. Nutrients and organic matter are related because the former contain the needed atoms necessary to build living cell and organism structures, corresponding to living organic matter, while the latter generally refers to dead organic matter and/or the assemblage of molecules which at one point were part of a living organism. This definition of the linkage between the two is hardly satisfying, however… When one looks at where the electrons are allocated on the important atoms, a much more unifying scheme appears. This chapter describes this unifying scheme. 2.1 The five fundamental requirements of life Before we dive down to the electron level, let us make sure we recognize that it is possible to simplify why there is, or not, life on our planet and the universe. Such a list includes: the presence of liquid water available nutrients that can fulfill the need for the six most numerous and important atoms that build most of our cell and organism structure: C, H, O, N, S, P. Without the commas comes this delightful acronym CHONSP which generations of students have come to love a source of energy, which in most cases is the form of solar or chemical energy electrons acceptor(s), without which chemical energy cannot be released and a suitable temperature range (about -5°C to +50°C) because of course most of living organisms will not live for very long outside this range There are many other requirements for life to occur, e.g., the ability to reproduce or even to die, but for what we are interested, this is a satisfying list. In this chapter, we will address the source of energy and what secret living organisms have found to store energy. Primary producers, which include most of chlorophyll containing plants from algae to angiosperms (flowering plants), have the ability to use solar radiations as a source of energy. An entire chapter is dedicated to this marvel. However, even for primary producers, solar radiations cannot be the sole source of energy, otherwise they would die at night… And for the rest of living organisms, solar radiations are just not a source of energy (merely a source of ‘bien-être’ or vitamin D for humans…!). So obviously, life has had to find a solution so that energy would be available for all conditions of light and temperature on earth. The first secret of life is the ability for store energy in the form of high energy electrons onto organic molecules. Having a source of energy is always a good thing. However, energy can only be released if there is an outlet for it, otherwise it stays as potential energy. Practically, this means that the energy stored on organic molecules can and is only released when the electrons go from the high potential to a lower one, or in others words from electron donors (organic molecules) to electron acceptors. This is the second secret of life on earth: on our planet exists this miracle molecule, O2, which acts as an extremely powerful electron acceptor. So you have to imagine O2 less as a gentle acceptor of electrons that organic matter would be kind enough to donate, but more like a very aggressive electron seeker and any organic matter located close to oxygen runs the risk to be oxidized, that is to lose its electrons. Sometimes, I like to refer to O2 as the electron kleptomaniac. So in oxygenated environments such as earth’s atmosphere and most water bodies, living organisms’ only concern is to have potential energy available in the form of high energy electrons stored onto organic molecules, because this energy can easily be released at any time thanks to the very oxidizing agent O2. Chapter 3 goes into the details of how this energy is released and transferred in cells. 2.2 Electron allocation onto CHONSP First, among the 6 atoms that form CHONSP, and this is true for all atoms except for noble gases which are stable monatomic atoms, none of them exist as monatomic atoms: they always form bonds with other atoms to form molecules. Among the CHONSP, three of them are homonuclear diatomic molecules, i.e., they can form molecules of two atoms of the same chemical element: H2 (dihydrogen, although it is most often referred to simply as hydrogen, which can be quite confusing), O2 (dioxygen, although oxygen is also most often used, unfortunately), and N2 (dinitrogen, which name is generally properly applied). Obviously, they can also bound to other elements, which is what we are about to see. If indeed, on our planet floats a very oxidizing agent in the form of O2, then the stable state of all other molecules should be where most other elements have lost their electrons to oxygen. And there ought to be techniques to see where the electrons are allocated on molecules. Chemists have created the oxidation state (OS) or oxidation number indicator which quantifies this electron allocation to some extent, but we find it to be rather confusing. For example if C, N, and S would have lost all their electrons, their OS would differ… In the first case, OSC = -4, OSN = -5, and OSS = -6, because the OS indicator is relative to the number of valence electrons in the free form of the atoms. More discussion and information on Oxidation State is available in the glossary of this book. This chapter is still under construction "],

All we need is to eat, drink, breath, and eliminate what we do not need. We could take our automobile cars as another example of bodies able to move about as long as they are fed some fuel. A lot of energy is realized from combustion of fuel or wood. In fact, provided that this energy be funneled into some very smart mechanical systems (e.g., combustion engines), and the energy power delivered is largely superior to any power any human could output. However, the energy consumed is also phenomenal and much of it is lost through heat. Life has found a way to be a lot more parsimonious with energy spending, which makes living organisms to be a lot more energy efficient than combustion in the long run: the respiration process. But in both the cases of combustion or of respiration, energy is liberated or transferred to ATP, respectively, when electrons are transferred from an electron donor to an electron acceptor. Not surprisingly, life and its diversity as we know it, has been able to develop on our planet because primary producers have been able to transfer and store solar energy into a chemical energy, where electrons are effectively stored onto organic molecules, and, because dioxygen O2, the most powerful electron acceptor, is freely floating in our atmosphere. But, then if we ourselves are nothing but a lot of organic matter, therefore a very large source of electrons, and if we leave in an oxygenated environment, how come we are not going into combustion? Obviously this applies to all living organisms. Some of you might think that it is because of the water. But then why would not a very dry piece of paper, or leaves, not automatically catch on fire? The answer lays in two words: activation energy. Electrons do not readily transfer from an electron donor to an electron acceptor because of the activation energy barrier which must be overcome. Activation energy is the level of energy necessary to be overcome for a reaction to carry on. On the figure below borrowed from Wikipedia, the energy difference between the peaks and the final energy level corresponds to the activation energy Ea Figure 3.1: Activation Energy (Ea) needed for a reaction to proceed. (Ea) can be lowered thanks to a catalyst, and in the case of the respiration chain of living organisms, many of them. Figure borrowed from Wikipedia, Copyrighted free use, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=779552 In normal conditions, this energy is preventing a reaction to proceed. This is why wood or most organic matter do not go into combustion or decomposition on their own. Nitroglycerin is notoriously unstable and the activation energy for electrons to be transferred to O2 is very small, hence its propensity to explode and its danger. However, the activation energy can be overcome with enough heat brought near an electron donor in the form of a flame or a spark. Not much heat is necessary for natural gas (CH4) for combustion to take place, i.e., for transfer of electrons from the carbon to oxygen, releasing twice the volume of gases: \\[\\begin{equation} CH_4 + O_2 \\Rightarrow CO_2 + H_2O \\tag{3.1} \\end{equation}\\] hence the explosive nature of this reaction. 3.2 Generating energy without combustion Now because none of us and all the living organisms with us, burn to generate energy, there must be other systems to manage to liberate energy, and, there must be ways to have much lower activation energy. Life has found several mechanisms to optimize the transfer of energy from organic matter to the a magic molecule: ATP or Adenosine TriPhosphate. 3.3 ATP or the energy currency of the cell There are many ways of transferring energy. To heat a house in the western world, we most often have a centralized heating (and sometimes cooling) system, where the heat is generated, e.g., in a furnace, and then transferred to the rest of the house via pipes and the like. The equivalent system might be for mammals the blood that gets re-oxygenated with the lungs, before it delivers oxygen throughout the body. At the cellular level, however, ATP or Adenosine TriPhosphate is created throughout the cell near the equivalent of the little furnaces: mitochondria. Needless to say, there is no combustion with the mitochondria, and yet transfer of electrons and energy delivered. The energy is transferred from the organic matter to ATP, and ATP being a relatively small molecule, can easily reach all metabolic processes, usually operated by proteins, which need energy to proceed (to overcome the activation energy mentioned above). Figure 3.2: ATP molecular structure containing adenosine (= adenine + ribose) and the three phosphate linked together with a pyrophosphate energy rich bond. Copyrighht Pearson Benjamin Cummings The key to storing energy is in the bond between the phosphate, which are often referred to as high-energy bonds. High-energy phosphate bonds are pyrophosphate bonds, acid anhydride linkages formed by taking phosphoric acid derivatives and dehydrating them. As a consequence, the hydrolysis of these bonds is exergonic under physiological conditions, releasing energy. As ATP releases its energy by the break of the pyrophosphate bond, ATP thus becomes ADP (Adenosine Diphosphate) and releases a phosphate in the meantime, like in figure 3.3. A common representation of this reaction is \\(ATP \\Rightarrow ADP + P_i\\) with the Pi referring to as a phosphate. Figure 3.3: Release of energy ATP hydrolyzed into ADP. http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Biology/atp.html Now that we have allocated electrons on atoms and molecules, you easily understand that the number of electrons on the outside of the triplet \\(PO_3-O-PO_2-O-PO_2\\) is huge. In his fantastic book, Degens (1989) suggests that because of the plethora of electrons on the triphosphate part of ATP, because the tetrahedral phosphate molecules are linked together by one of the corners of each tetrahedron (figure 3.4), and because of the \\(\\pi\\) electron bonds (double bond) which tends to repulse each other (Degens 1989), the triphosphate molecule can only be in constant movement, which ‘maintains the animated world’ (Degens 1989). Figure 3.4: Tetrahedral configuration of each of the phosphate molecule which when linked together supposedly are in constant movement 3.4 The ATP manufacture If ATP freely releases energy for a reaction to proceed in the cell, as ATP becomes ADP + Pi, there must be energy at one point to ‘manufacture’ or recharge the ATP molecule in the first place. We have seen that much of the energy in the cell is transferred thanks to the ATP molecule. So could we just make ATP from the energy liberated by ATP??? The answer is no, obviously… The energy to create ATP has to come from elsewhere, otherwise it just cannot work…!!! Life has found a wonderful way to do that thanks to proton flows. Yes, that is correct, a proton flow. ATP is literally formed from an ADP and a phosphate and assembled thanks to a protein called ATP synthase, or ATPase, which seems to be activated or powered almost mechanically, very much like a water mill, by a proton flow (Figure 3.5). The ‘head’ of the ATPase, which looks a bit like a ‘mushroom hat’, referred to as the FO region, rotates as a result of the proton flow and allows the phosphorylation of ADP. It is thus fair to call the ATPase a ‘proton mill’. You may want to look at this very nice concise document on ATP synthase on Wikipedia, which provides more detailed information and shows quite nicely how the mechanical force of the H+ flow is thought to allow Pi to be attached to an ADP. This part of the energy recovery is referred to as phosphorylation. Figure 3.5: Artist representation of the ATP synthase powered, almost mechanically by proton flows. By The original uploader was Asw-hamburg at German Wikipedia - Transferred from de.wikipedia to Commons by Leyo using CommonsHelper., CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=8993938 So, this mechanical force is what generates the synthesis of ATP from ADP, or again phosphorylation. So this solves that part of the ATP synthesis. Now, another mechanism must be responsible for the formation of the proton flow. 3.5 Creating a proton gradient as a source of proton flow Until now, I have not even mentioned where all this takes place. We are about to see where this happens. But first, let us take an analogy to better understand the proton flow responsible for the synthesis of ATP. Flow of matter just does not happen on its own, it only happens as a result of a gradient between a compartment and another. Using the water mill analogy, the reason why there is release of energy in the form of kinetic energy of the water is because there is a drop in elevation, and therefore in potential energy between the ‘compartments’ upstream and downstream the mill. To increase the hydraulic gradient, men throughout the world have built dams to create compartments and increase the hydraulic gradient between upstream and downstream the mill. So in the water mill analogy, the hydraulic gradient is maintained thanks to the dam which creates compartments, and to the continuous arrival of new water upstream and to the leaving of water downstream. So three things are necessary for the release of kinetic energy (which in the end is going to power the rotation of a mill wheel, and in the old days would grind wheat or corn grain): a system to compartmentalize water, a supply of water, and, an outlet for the water so that is does not accumulate. By analogy, the formation of ATP corresponds to the grain grinding; the proton flow corresponds to the water flowing that activates the mill wheel, and in our case the proton flow activates the ATPase. We now need to address the three parts of the system needed to have a proton gradient and flow: a compartment system, a proton supply system, and, a system to use protons so the gradient is maintained. 3.5.1 A compartment to accumulate protons We saw earlier that the double phospholipid layer made the cell membrane. Well if you close a membrane on itself you will make a compartment or a balloon. It turns out that if you look at a typical prokaryotic cell and at organelles in a eukaryotic cell (Figure 3.6), there are compartments formed between a cell wall and the plasma membrane for prokaryotic cells, and between two double layer phospholipid membranes for the eukaryotic cells. So in reality, it is a bit as if one were to create a space between two balloons. Figure 3.6: Artist representation of a prokaryotic cell and a mitochondrion from a eukaryotic showing the intermembrane spaces: between the cell wall and plasma membrane for the prokaryotic cell, and, between the outer and inner membranes for the mitochondrion. https://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/cells/animals/animalmodel.html and By Kelvinsong - Own work, CC0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=27715320 At the end though, there exists for prokaryotic cells and mitochondria (and most organelles for eukaryotic cell) an inter-membrane space, which effectively creates compartments to accumulate ‘things’. The double phospholipid membrane is so strong and so tight that it is proton-tight. In other words, if somehow protons accumulate in this inter-membrane space, protons cannot leave through the membrane, they can only leave through designated areas. And yes, you guessed right, the designated area for protons to leave the inter-membrane space is the ATP synthase! So to take another analogy, you can imagine an inner tube full of air under pressure, air can only leave through the valve. And if you were to put a little fan in front of the valve as you are releasing air, the fan would rotate. Imagine that this is essentially what happens: the ATPase is both the valve and the fan as it literally rotates with the proton flow. 3.5.2 A supply of protons for the intermembrane space: proton pumps Now, the next natural question is that in the case of an inner tube, somebody pumped some air into the tube to put it under pressure. Similarly, there must be a system that pumps protons into the inter-membrane space. And yes indeed, you guessed it right, there are proton pumps that do the job. But again, these pumps must be powered by some sort of energy. Let us pause for a second. We have seen in section 3.1 that generally speaking, energy is generated from the transfer of electrons. But until now, we have not even mentioned electrons: only ATP and protons…? This is where electrons come in: energetic electrons transported onto electron transfer molecules are the ones that power the proton pumps!. It is time to take a bird’s eye view again. Energy liberation exists when electrons are transferred from an electron donor to an electron acceptor. Life has found a way to capture this energy in the form of ATP, which allows transportation of energy to the needed places in the cell. So the energy transfer in the cell does not have to be totally instantaneous like combustion would be, and it can be spent exactly where it needs to be spent. Yet, the production of ATP is in fact generated by an electron transfer, but indirectly. No, electrons are NOT transferred from organic matter to ATP. Yes, electrons are ultimately transferred from organic matter to an electron acceptor, which in the case of aerobic respiration is O2. But just like the generation of ATP is indirectly linked to the electron transfer, the transfer of electrons from organic matter to the ultimate electron acceptor is also indirect. A set of molecules called electron transfer molecules are intermediate carrier of electrons and are the ones which power the proton pumps as represented in figure 3.7 below. Figure 3.7: Artist representation of the ATP synthesis powered by a proton flow, itself powered by a proton gradient, itself produced thanks to proton pumps powered by energy rich electrons carried by electron transfer molecules. Obtained from 2006 Pearson Education 3.5.3 Electron transfer molecules that power the proton pumps The two main electron transfer molecules in the respiration process are called NAD (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide; figure 3.8) and FAD (flavine adenine dinucleotide; figure 3.9). These two nucleotides have the ability to be reduced (= gain electrons) and oxidized (= lose electrons), and because they are mobile, to carry electrons from the cell (bacteria) or mitochondrion (eukaryot) cytoplasm to the proton pumps. Figure 3.8: Molecular formula of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD) in both oxydized and reduced states Figure 3.9: Molecular formula of Flavine Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD) in both oxydized and reduced states 3.6 Transfer of electrons from the Organic Carbon to an electron acceptor So this answers the question of how the proton pumps are powered, but it is now time to look at the global fate of electrons: where do they come from and where do they end up? Actually, we already know the global answers to these questions: the electrons are stored unto the C, N, and S of organic molecules and they are eventually accepted by an electron acceptor; in the case of aerobic respiration, O2 is the ultimate electron acceptor. Before there might be any confusion, in the aerobic respiration process that involves organic molecules as electron donors (we will see that inorganic molecules can also be electron donors), strangely enough, the only atom which donates electron is carbon while the nitrogen and sulfur atoms keep all their eight electrons. Specialized microbes, called lithotrophs, literally ‘feed on stone’, which means that their source of electron is from an inorganic molecule, have the ability to use ammonium and hydrogen sulfide as electron donor (8 electrons available for ‘donation’) in their aerobic respiration chains. So all this to say that in aerobic respiration that involves organic matter, only the carbon atom donates its electrons. The organisms which use organic matter as electron donors are called organotrophs. We, as mammals and humans, are organotrophs. 3.6.1 Oxygen reduction Let us start from the end of the process: the reduction of oxygen into H2O, as represented on figure 3.7 above. As the NAD and FAD are powering proton pumps (which names include FMN, ubiquinone, cytochrome a, b, and c see figure 3.7), the electrons lose some of their energy and migrate within the phospholipid membrane from the proton pumps towards the ATPase. Because of the involvement of many different proteins involved in this transport, this is referred to as the electron transfer chain. Because the NAD and the FAD molecules are oxidized (they have given up their electrons), and because at the ATPase location, ADP gains a phosphate to become ATP, the whole process is referred to as oxidative phosphorylation. At the confluence between the ATPase and the cytochrome a3, the reaction (3.2) occurs: \\[\\begin{equation} O_2 + 4 e^- + 4 H^+ \\Rightarrow 2 H_2O \\tag{3.2} \\end{equation}\\] This is the place where the electrons are accepted!!! So now you know exactly where all this is happening! Is not that wonderful? So the electrons are accepted by O2 (remember on a molecule of O2, each Oxygen atom only has 6 electrons for itself, so each can accept two more), and these electrons reduce oxygen into H2O. This has several consequences: the reduction of O2 also consumes 4 H+, which solves the necessity for an outlet for protons as they flow out of the inter-membrane through the ATPase, which was the third condition to maintain a proton gradient the reduction of O2 obviously consumes electrons, which also provides an outlet for the electrons. In order words, if no electron acceptors are available, then the electrons at the proton pumps have no outlet, so the proton pumps are stalled, which in turn halts the maintaining of a proton gradient, which eventually stops the production of ATP. 3.6.2 Electron fate from organic matter to electron transfer molecules The fate of electrons from organic matter or glucose to the electron transfer molecules involves two processes called glycolysis and the Krebs or citric acid cycle. Biology majors have to learn in details all the steps and the name of the molecules involved in these chain reactions. This is beside our point for our class. Instead I want you to understand and know that these reactions involve transfer of electrons from organic carbon onto electron transfer molecules the release of carbon atoms which have lost all their electrons, therefore releasing C in the form of CO2. the hydrolysis of glucose molecules to pyruvate, a C3 molecule (a 3 carbon organic molecule) during the glycolysis, which then loses CO2 as it enters the citric cycle the acetyl-coA, a co-enzyme is key to incorporate organic carbon in the Krebs cycle. In figure 3.10 below which summarizes all the aerobic respiration pathways, you can see that most of the ATP is formed thanks to the proton flow, and that electron transfer molecules are involved in all steps. Figure 3.10: Summary of cellular respiration with the ATP and electron transfer budget. Obtained from https://cdn.thinglink.me/api/image/847806852426104839/1240/10/scaletowidth This 3.10 diagram does not show where the CO2 are produced so I invite to see, in addition to the notes given in class, that CO2 is released as pyruvic acid enters in the figures 3.12 and 3.11 below. Figure 3.11: Glycolysis pathway. Image Figure 3.12: Krebs or citric acid cycle pathway. 3.7 Summary of respiration We have purposely presented the molecular processes of respiration starting from the end and moving back to the beginning of the respiration chain. We can summarize the respiration process again in that order: the goal of respiration is to transfer energy initially stored as high energy electrons on organic molecules to ATP, the energy currency of the cell The production of ATP itself has to come from a different source of energy than that liberated by ATP itself ATP is synthesized by the phosphorylation of ADP by the ATP synthase, itself powered by a proton flow from the inter-membrane space to the cytoplasm space the proton flow is powered by a proton gradient between the inter-membrane space and the cytoplasm space This gradient is made possible thanks to a proton-tight compartment corresponding to the inter-membrane space a supply of protons from the cytoplasm to the inter-membrane space, fed by proton pumps an outlet for the protons flowing out and powering the ATPase (‘the proton mill’), which combined with the reduction of oxygen form water molecules The proton pumps are themselves powered by the oxidation of electron transfer molecules (NAD and FAD), which carry high energy electrons from the Krebs or citric cycle to the electron transfer chain The electron transfer molecules accept the electrons, or are reduced during glycolysis, before and during the Krebs cycle as organic carbon are oxidized or lose their electrons and release CO2. The other way to present respiration is to say that: Energy rich electrons stored on organic molecules are transferred onto electron transfer molecules during glycolysis, before and during the Krebs cycle The high energy electrons thus transported power proton pumps placed in the inner membrane of the cell for unicellular organisms or of the mitochodrion for eukaryotic cells These pumps feed a supply of protons to the inter-membrane space which, because this space is proton-tight, and because protons outlets are limited to the ATP synthase, creates an accumulation of protons in this space The accumulation of protons creates a proton gradient between the inter-membrane space and the cytoplasm, which generates a proton flow at designated ‘holes’ in the membrane The protons flow out the inter-membrane through the ATP synthase which can be approximated by proton canals and almost mechanically turn the ATPase head which acts as a ‘proton mill’ This proton mill catalyzes the phosphorylation of ADP into ATP The proton gradient is maintained possible because the protons flowing out of the inter-membrane space are combined with electrons reducing oxygen into water The electron flow is maintained thanks to the same oxygen reduction, which in turns allows electron transfer molecules to be oxidized so that then can take their ‘proton load’ again. Overall respiration consists in transferring high energy electrons from organic molecules to oxygen, and by doing so creating a proton gradient which in turn is the main driver for the formation of ATP in the cell. Both summaries present the same story but have their own logic. Other important subtleties of respiration include: In the case organic molecules are the source of electrons, only the carbon atom donates electrons, the amine and thiol radicals being eliminated as a by-product DO NOT donate their electrons in this respiration system. This is admittedly a bit weird as the the amine and thiol groups still have 8 electrons to donate each. 3.8 Respiration electron flow schemes 3.8.1 Linkages between respiration and microbial processes These few paragraphs and pages were necessary but we now need to connect them with some of the practical consequences that concern ecological engineering. The electron donors are the fuel for all microbial processes involved in the substrate of ‘treatment systems’. The byproduct of the loss of electrons originally stored on the electron donor will be a source of inorganic molecules that matter When the electron acceptor is O2, this results in an oxygen demand which may have consequences on the overall oxygen level and may lead to anaerobic conditions, where other electron acceptors come in play We try to take advantage of the anaerobic conditions to dissipate or strip excess nutrients, e.g. NO3- 3.8.2 Respiration schemes So we thought we could provide a nice concise summary of respiration to highlight the points that matter for environmental and microbial considerations in the form of respiration schemes, still maintaining some of the important drivers of the formation of ATP. In the first respiration scheme in Figure 3.13 below, the transfer of electrons is represented by the blue wavy line. Electrons are transferred from an electron donor to an electron acceptor. The consequences of the transfer are represented in thicker light blue arrows. The first consequence of the transfer of electrons is the powering of proton pumps, which in turn create a proton gradient in the inter-membrane space, which result into proton flow, which gives the necessary energy to catalyze the phosphorylation of ADP into ATP. The products of oxidation, reduction, and phosphorylation are represented in black arrows. Figure 3.13: Generic respiration scheme illustrating the flow of electrons from an electron donor to and electron acceptor, the by-products of the respective oxidation and reduction, and the consequences on proton gradients and flow, which ultimately help catalyse the formation of ATP The respiration scheme is obviously an oversimplified representation of the what happens as described above, but generally holds true. Some ATP are generated during glycolysis and in association with the Krebs cycle, but represent 4 out of a total of 38, or about 10% of the total. So it is probably fair to simplify things to represent the majority of the processes (here 90%). The beauty of this scheme is that it applies to just about all types of electron donors and acceptors. 3.8.3 Aerobic respiration schemes for organotrophs In the next scheme, we take the classic example of aerobic respiration, where glucose is considered as the electron donor, and O2 the electron acceptor. Figure 3.14: Aerobic respiration scheme illustrating the flow of electrons from glucose to O2, the by-products of the respective oxidation and reduction being CO2 and H2O, and H2O. The consequences of the transfer of electrons on proton pumps, gradients and flow, which ultimately help catalyse the formation of ATP, do not change from the generic respiration scheme above Using the generic carbohydrate CH2O as a source of electrons, it is possible to express the donation of electrons in equation (3.3) (redox half reaction): \\[\\begin{equation} CH_2O + H_2O \\rightarrow CO_2 + 4 H^+ + 4 e^- \\tag{3.3} \\end{equation}\\] Organisms which use organic molecules as electron donors are referred to as organotrophs, hence the title. We shall see later that some microorganisms are able to use inorganic molecules as their electron donors. In our case (Figure 3.14), the byproduct of glucose as the carbon atoms lose all their electrons becomes CO2 as show in equation (3.3). In turn, the electrons are accepted by O2 following equation (3.4) \\[\\begin{equation} O_2 + 4 H^+ + 4 e^- \\rightarrow 4H_2O \\tag{3.4} \\end{equation}\\] The combination of donating electrons from glucose (equation (3.3)), or organic matter illustrated in Figure 3.15, combined with the accepting of these electrons by O2 (equation (3.4)), results in the combined overall summary of aerobic respiration: \\[\\begin{equation} CH_2O + O_2 \\rightarrow CO_2 + H_2O \\tag{3.5} \\end{equation}\\] The third scheme (Figure 3.15), the generic term organic matter is used to show that in reality, not only glucose can be part of the electron transfer chain, but essentially all types of organic molecules, as represented in Figure 3.16. So the only difference with the previous scheme with glucose only, are the by-products of the catabolism of organic matter: CO2, NH4+, HS-, and PO43-. Figure 3.15: Aerobic respiration scheme illustrating the flow of electrons from organic matter to O2, the by-products of the oxidation of OM include ammonium, hydrogen sulfide and phosphate this time The important thing to notice here is that the N and S atoms, which in organic molecules possess 8 electrons for themselves, or are fully reduced, stay reduced as byproducts of respiration. This might appear odd as mentioned before, because there are electrons available for another oxidation to take place. Lithotroph micro-organisms are specialized in taking advantage of these available electrons, as we shall see later. The important message here is that you can see that respiration processes essentially breakdown large molecules into small inorganic ones, and that in the case of respiration for organotrophs, the only atom to lose its electrons is carbon. Figure 3.16: Oxidative phosphorylation of organic molecules of carbohydrates but of other molecular families as well. Figure obtained from Essential Cell Biology from Garland Science If we think about this apparent oddity, N and S are a lot more electronegative than C, so in the organotroph cell, it is a lot easier for oxygen to strip electrons from carbon than it is from N and S. It might be worth taking a hydraulic analogy: in a soil, pore water will tend to drain through the area of a soil that has the highest hydraulic conductivity, or use the path of least resistance, totally by-passing areas of lower hydraulic conductivity. Chemically, it is just a lot easier to obtain electrons and energy out of the reduced carbon, and a lot harder to obtain them from amine (-NH2) and thiol (-SH) radicals; this is why N and S stay in a reduced form as byproducts of organotrophic respiration. Again, several group of lithotrophs specifically target the electrons on ammonium and on Hydrogen sulfide, and use O2 as their electron acceptor. In the next chapter, we will introduce all the respiration processes, aerobic and anaerobic, and performed by organotrophs and lithotrophs. References "],

We took aerobic respiration as our model to determine that most of the ATP produced in the cell is principally due to a proton flow from the inter-membrane space to the cytoplasm, for microbial cells and within the mitochondria for eukaryotic cells (Figure 3.10). The respiration schemes provide a very handy method to summarize the important drivers and consequences of respiration: the electron donors, the electron acceptors, and the byproducts of both oxidation and reduction. In this chapter we will use the same respiration schemes to explore the processes at play in wetland soils and the consequences on concentration gradients and movement of molecules of importance in environmental and ecological engineering. 4.1 The theoretical vertical sequence of respiratory processes in wetland soils The theoretical wetland soil used to illustrate our point has ‘enough’ organic matter content for microbial respiration to take place throughout its profile, ‘enough’ of other sand, silt, and clay and all the minerals that accompany them, including iron and manganese oxides. Let us assume that this theoretical soil, is sufficiently moist and aerated for microbial aerobic respiration to take place throughout the soil profile. Let us then assume that this soil is suddenly flooded, and let us explore the consequences of this. 4.1.1 An aerobic layer near the soil-water interface At first, all micro-organisms are going to use all the oxygen that might be present in the pore space. But because pore space is now getting filled with water, it is possible that the amount of oxygen available for microorganisms might change. And yes, indeed, water does not have nearly the capacity to provide oxygen as air does for several reasons: at 15°C in water there are about 10 mg of O2 in one liter of water. Comparatively, in one liter of air, there is about 300 mg of O2, or 30 times more. How does one calculate this? At standard conditions, 1 liter of air at 21% oxygen possesses 0.21 L of oxygen. Since for these conditions, 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 L, simply divide 0.21/22.4, to arrive at 0.0094 moles of oxygen. Then the mass of oxygen in 1 liter of air is 0.0094×32 g/mole = 300 mg. the diffusivity (which quantifies the ability of elements to move about) of O2 in air is 0.176 cm²/s while that of O2 in water is 2.10×10−5 cm²/s, or more than 8,000 times smaller (Wikipedia contributors 2017) In other words, it is good to remember that the amount of oxygen available in water compared to air is about 30 less, and that oxygen in water moves almost 10,000 slower than in water. So, one can clearly see that the potential supply of oxygen from flooded porewater is thus a lot more limited than in aerated pore space. Now, where is the potential source for supply of oxygen for our recently flooded soil? The answer is the atmosphere. For a real flooded wetland soil, another source of O2 might be photosynthesis from algae and aquatic vegetation during the day. But in all cases, most of the oxygen needed for microbial aerobic respiration of our new flooded soil will have to travel the distance corresponding to the thickness of the water column, and, the linear distance within the porous medium of the soil, which can be quite tortuous. This property of the soil/sediment has been factored in by researchers and been called tortuosity. In summary, the supply of oxygen to bacteria in a flooded soil is limited because of four factors: there is about 30 times less O2 in water than there is in the same volume of air the O2 diffusive transport capacity in water is about 10,000 times smaller than that in air O2 has to travel from the atmosphere to the soil through the thickness of the water column, and travel through the tortuous path of the soil porous medium Not surprisingly, this supply is just too limited compared to the demand. As a result, most of our recently flooded soil bacteria consumes all the O2 and the only part of the sediment that might have a little bit of oxygen is the area at the soil-water interface. This is what it illustrated in Figure 4.1 below. Figure 4.1: Animation summarizing the formation of aerobic and anaerobic zones of a theoretical flooded wetland soil due to the imbalance between bacterial respiratory oxygen demand and oxygen supply through the water column Because the O2 demand exceeds the O2 supply from the atmosphere and the water column, an O2 concentration gradient forms from the soil-water interface down. This concentration gradient, in turn, drives a downward movement of oxygen from the water column into the sediment down to the depth where there is no more concentration gradient. This depth defines the beginning of the anaerobic zone of the sediment, and above, the aerobic layer of the sediment. 4.1.2 Respiration in the anaerobic zone of the soil What happens to all the microbes in the anaerobic zone of the sediment? Certainly the exclusively aerobic microbes just do not survive, but most bacteria are facultative aerobs. In other words, they can switch from aerobic to anaerobic respiration. Let us state this again: in the anaerobic zone of the sediment, only unicellular microorganisms are able to survive and have had to adapt their respiration to still be able to produce ATP for their metabolism, but using electron acceptors other than O2. It turns out that thermodynamics dictate that not all electron acceptors can generate the same amount of energy when they strip electrons from their electron donors. As a result, one can classify electron acceptors in decreasing order from the most to the least oxidizing, and the list of preferred electron acceptors goes as such: nitrate or NO3- Manganese oxide (MnO2) or Mn IV Iron oxides/hydroxyde or Fe III sulfate or SO42- Carbon dioxide or CO2 Although very different microbes are involved at the different stages, the apparent demand for electron acceptor, in our theoretical wetland soil, can be described as a temporal sequence of events: oxygen is the preferred electron acceptor; when O2 is all used, NO3- will be used as the preferred electron acceptor; when all the NO3- is used, the next most powerful electron acceptor is MnO2 (also referred to Mn IV; IV corresponds to its oxidation state), which is present in a solid or mineral form in soils; when all the MnO2 is used, then iron oxide or hydroxyde, which are also in the solid phase (also referred to Fe III, III corresponds to its oxidation state) will be used as the preferred electron acceptor; when all the Fe is used, then SO42- is used as the next preferred electron acceptor, and then when finally all the other electron acceptors have been all used, CO2 can be the ultimate electron acceptor…! Finally, to this temporal sequence corresponds a theoretical spatial sequence or zones where each of the electron acceptor essentially defines a soil layer, with the layers are organized with depth from the most to the least oxidizing electron acceptor as represented in Figure 4.2 Figure 4.2: Theoretical spatial layering of wetland soils corresponding to the electron acceptor available, not too long after flooding. In each layer, the oxidizing and the reduced forms are illustrated as oxidizing/reduced. Not to scale It is now time to present the respiration processes in each of the redox layer. 4.1.3 A denitrification layer below the aerobic layer The next most powerful or oxidizing electron acceptor after O2 is NO3-. We have seen in the previous chapters that the N atom in nitrate has zero electron for itself, hence its ability to accept electrons. Just like for aerobic respiration, nitrate reduction just does not happen on its own. Facultative anaerobic bacteria called denitrifiers take advantage of the electrons available on organic matter and of nitrate to accept them to generate their energy. The denitrification of this theoretical wetland soil is referred to as heterotrophic denitrification because the source of carbon for these denitrifiers is also the source of electron, as OM is the source of both. On a side note, there are autolithotrophic denitrifiers, which use pyrite FeS2 as their source of electrons, and have to find their carbon from another source than OM. There are two possible byproducts of nitrate reduction: N2, which is the inert gas that makes 78% of our atmosphere, and N2O, which is a potent greenhouse gas. The byproduct of the oxidation of OM are the same as the ones in aerobic heterotrophic respiration, i.e., CO2, NH4+, HS-, and PO43-. Figure 4.3: Respiration scheme for heterotrophic denitrification In reality, you will find in textbooks that denitrification involves not a direct reduction of nitrate into N2 or N2O, but rather a sequence of reductions, summarized in equation (4.1), where nitrite, nitrogen monoxide, and nitrous oxides are intermediate products: \\[\\begin{equation} NO_3^- \\rightarrow NO_2^- \\rightarrow NO \\rightarrow N_2O \\rightarrow N_2 \\tag{4.1} \\end{equation}\\] Nitrous oxide is thus a sign of an incomplete denitrification. Because denitrification currently is the one mechanism, which removes nitrogen from the aqueous phase as gaseous byproduct, it currently ranks as the most effective ways to treat excess nitrogen in water. Entire research programs are dedicated to the development of methods and treatment systems to optimize this process. One of the active research areas is about finding ways to have have denitrification go all the way to the N2 stage to minimize the production of N2O. Because this is a reduction process, and because nitrate is not assimilated in the denitrifier cells, a very short and good definition of denitrification is the microbially mediated dissimilatory reduction of nitrate into dinitrogen. Nitrate reduction (= gains electrons) in denitrification is illustrated in equation (4.2): \\[\\begin{equation} 2 NO_3^- + 10 e^- + 12 H^+ \\rightarrow N_2 + 6 H_2O \\tag{4.2} \\end{equation}\\] A more complete and more descriptive definition of denitrification is Denitrification refers to the dissimilatory reduction, by essentially aerobic bacteria, of one or both of the ionic nitrogen oxides (nitrate, NO3-, and nitrite, NO2-) to the gaseous oxides (nitric oxide, NO, and nitrous oxide, N20), which may themselves be further reduced to dinitrogen (N2). The nitrogen oxides act as terminal electron acceptors in the absence of oxygen. The gaseous nitrogen species are major products of these reductive processes. (Knowles 1982) Denitrification is thought to be inhibited by the presence of oxygen, and thus only occurs in our theoretical wetland soil, below the aerobic layer. However, denitrification only occurs if there is nitrate present as electron acceptor. Therefore, for denitrification to proceed, there must be a supply of nitrate that can compensate the demand due to denitrification. The only place from where nitrate can be supplied, is the water column, and, possibly, the aerobic layer of the sediment where nitrification can take place, as we shall see later. Following the same analysis as that of aerobic respiration, because of the transport distance for nitrate from the water column and through the aerobic layer of the sediment, the supply tends to be lower than the demand. This, with the demand below the supply, creates a concentration gradient, which generates a downward flux of nitrate from the water column through the aerobic zone of the sediment into the denitrification zone (layer 2 in Figure 4.2). Nitrate thus just diffuse through layer 1, and is only used as electron acceptor in layer 2. Because the demand exceeds the supply, nitrate cannot move further down than the bottom of layer 2. Denitrification is thus restricted to layer 2. 4.1.4 Manganese and Iron oxides reductions Below the denitrification layer, microbes have to find new electron acceptors for their respiration. After O2, which is a gas, NO3-, which is a dissolved ion, the next elements which serve as electron acceptors are solids: Manganese and Iron oxides. They will serve as electron acceptors, only if soil minerals containing Mn and Fe oxides are present. In our theoretical wetland soil, the assumption is that these oxides are present. In layer 3 (Figure 4.2), MnO2 serve as the electron acceptor following the general equation (4.3) and respiration scheme illustrated in Figure 4.4. \\[\\begin{equation} MnO_2 + 4 e^- + 4 H^+ \\rightarrow Mn^{2+} + 2 H_2O \\tag{4.3} \\end{equation}\\] Figure 4.4: Respiration scheme for heterotrophic Manganese oxide reduction While the electron donor is immobile, the reduction of MnO2 (equation (4.3)) produces Mn2+ ions, which are dissolved, mobile in water, and can diffuse following concentration gradients. In our original hypothesis of the sudden flooding of the wetland soil, MnO2 oxides would be reduced from layer 3 down. The Mn2+ ions produced in these layers, and the lack of Mn2+ ions in layers 1 and 2, would create a concentration gradient, which would generate an upward flux of Mn2+, this time, from layers 3 to 6 into layers 2 and 1. The fate of Mn2+ ions as they reach the aerobic layer is discussed below. After the MnO2 oxides are reduced, the iron oxides and hydroxide minerals will similarly serve as electron donors following the general equation (4.4), and respiration scheme illustrated in Figure 4.5. The reduction of an iron hydroxide Fe(OH)3 has been added to show that in reality, Fe3+ never exists as such, but almost always as iron oxides or hydroxides. Many forms of iron oxides exist in soils, hence the choice of choosing iron hydroxide Fe(OH)3 in equation (4.4). Fe3+, Fe(OH)3, and other iron oxides are referred to as ferric iron or Fe(III), because their oxidation state is 3. Ferric iron generally has an orange rusty color. \\[\\begin{align} Fe^{3+} + 1 e^- &amp; \\rightarrow &amp; Fe^{2+} \\\\ Fe(OH)_3 + 1 e^- + 3 H^+ &amp; \\rightarrow &amp; Fe^{2+} + 3 H_2O \\tag{4.4} \\end{align}\\] The overall transfer of electrons from the organic matter can be written as: \\[\\begin{equation} CH_2O + 4 Fe^{3+} + H_2O \\rightarrow 4 Fe^{2+} + CO_2 + 4 H^+ \\tag{4.5} \\end{equation}\\] Figure 4.5: Respiration scheme for heterotrophic Iron oxide reduction Similarly to Mn2+ ions, Fe2+ ions, or ferrous iron, or Fe(II) is a dissolved iron which is mobile in water, and can diffuse following concentration gradients. For the same reasons explained above for Mn2+, an upward concentration gradient between zones 4 to 6 and layers 3 to 1 is going to appear and the Fe2+ ions will tend to diffuse upward through layers 3 and 2. The fate of Fe2+ ions as they reach the aerobic layer is discussed below. This vertical spatial sequence of layers 3 and 4 presented here probably only applies not too long after the theoretical wetland soil has been flooded. Indeed, over the long periods, the supply of ferric iron and manganese oxides will run out, as the only supply is in immobile mineral forms. So over long periods, layers 3 and 4 do not exist. Is the case of a no net downward water infiltration, the Fe2+ and Mn2+ ions diffuse upward all the way into the aerobic layer, and accumulate there for reasons illustrated below. In the more likely case of small but real net downward flux of water, the dissolved ions will leach out of the soil profile. The consequences are that poorly drained soils then to leach out their iron and manganese, which is referred to as iron and manganese depletion. This is the reason for the grey color of hydric soils (Figure 4.6). Figure 4.6: Example of pale bluish gray redox depletions. Note the faint rusty orange concentration distributed throughout the soil matrix. Reproduced with permission © 2012 Nature Education All rights reserved. 4.1.5 Sulfate reduction After all previous electron acceptors have been used, sulfate becomes the next electron acceptor. As we have seen before, the sulfur atom on SO42- has zero electrons for itself and it therefore can accept electrons following redox half-reaction equation (4.6). \\[\\begin{equation} SO_4^{2-} + 8 e^- + 10 H^+ \\rightarrow H_2S + 4 H_2O \\tag{4.6} \\end{equation}\\] While the electron donor is still organic matter as shown in Figure 4.7, the overall transfer of electron from the OM to sulfate can be written as: \\[\\begin{equation} 2 CH_2O + SO_4^{2-} + 2 H^+ \\rightarrow H_2S + 2 CO_2 + 2 H_2O \\tag{4.7} \\end{equation}\\] Figure 4.7: Respiration scheme for heterotrophic Iron oxide reduction Typical concentrations of sulfate in ground- and stream waters are between 1 and 10 mg SO42-/L. In our theoretical wetland soil profile, sulfate that might be originally present in the porewater will be reduced in layers 5 and 6 of Figure 4.2. For the same reasons invoked for oxygen and nitrate, the potential source of supply for sulfate for the sulfate reducing layer is all the sulfate that might be present in the layers above and the water column. The demand for sulfate in layer 5 will create a downward concentration gradient which will generate a downward diffusive movement of sulfate down to layer 5. And again, because of all the diffusion distance, the supply of SO42- is limited and does not match the demand. The imbalance between the sulfate supply and demand will limit the diffusion of sulfate to the bottom of layer 5, below which there will be no sulfate any more.

They are ordered in alphabetical list for better retrieval and look up. 5.1 A 5.1.1 Aerobic respiration 5.1.2 Anaerobic respiration 5.1.3 Ammonia Ammonia is a colorless gas with a characteristic pungent smell Formula: \\(NH_3\\) Ammonia 3D shape: Lewis dot structure: Number of electron N has for itself following electronegativity rule: eight \\(NH_3\\) can only be an electron donor Because N has so many electrons to be potentially donated, ammonia is generally unstable in an aerobic environment. As a result, it tends to trace quantities in nature When dissolved in water, and depending on the pH of the solution, ammonia converts to ammonium following the reaction: \\[ H_2O + NH_3 \\rightleftharpoons OH^{-} + NH_4^{+} \\] Production: Because of its many uses, ammonia is one of the most highly produced inorganic chemicals. Dozens of chemical plants worldwide produce ammonia. Consuming more than 1% of all man-made power, ammonia production is a significant component of the world energy budget. In 2014, about 88% of the ammonia produced was used for fertilizing agricultural crops Modern ammonia-producing plants generally depend on the Haber-Bosch process which consists into reducing dinitrogen into ammonia \\[ 3\\,H_2 + N_2 \\to 2\\,NH_3 \\] Consumption: Ammonia is directly or indirectly the precursor to most nitrogen-containing compounds. Virtually all synthetic nitrogen compounds are derived from ammonia. back to top 5.1.4 Ammonium Ammonium is the most reduced inorganic nitrogenous cation (positively charged). Ammonium 3D shape: Lewis dot structure: Number of electron N has for itself following electronegativity rule: eight It is formed by the protonation of ammonia following the reaction: \\[\\begin{equation} H_2O + NH_3 \\rightleftharpoons OH^{-} + NH_4^{+} \\tag{5.1} \\end{equation}\\] The relative abundance of ammonium vs ammonia depends on the pH of the solution. See figure below Because in most natural aqueous environments, pH is below 8, ammonium tends to be the preponderant form. Production: In nature, ammonium is a waste product of the mineralization of organic molecules It is added as fertilizer on soils as ammonium nitrate Health hazard: Ammonia vapor has a sharp, irritating, pungent odor that acts as a warning of potentially dangerous exposure Exposure to very high concentrations of gaseous ammonia can result in lung damage and death Drinking water standard: back to top 5.1.5 Ammonium nitrate Ammonium nitrate is a chemical compound, the nitrate salt of the ammonium cation It is a white crystal solid and is highly soluble in water. Formula: \\(NH_4NO_3\\) 3D shape: It is predominantly used in agriculture as a high-nitrogen fertilizer Its other major use is as a component of explosive mixtures used in mining, quarrying, and civil construction Production: Ammonium nitrate does exist naturally in mines of the Atacama desert in Chile but globally nearly all ammonium nitrate is now produced synthetically Byproduct of all respiration processes. Ammonium ions are a waste product of the metabolism of animals. In fish and aquatic invertebrates, it is excreted directly into the water. In mammals, sharks, and amphibians, it is converted in the urea cycle to urea, because urea is less toxic and can be stored more efficiently. In birds, reptiles, and terrestrial snails, metabolic ammonium is converted into uric acid, which is solid and can therefore be excreted with minimal water loss. Consumption/utilization: It is used as a fertilizer, because it tends to release inorganic nitrogen slowly in soil. Applied as a surface fertilizer, it penetrates the soil with rainfall infiltration. Highly soluble, the nitrate anion becomes readily available to plant roots, although it is susceptible to leaching below the root system into the shallow and deep groundwater. The ammonium cation tends to adsorb to soil particles and is thus not as susceptible to leaching. Ammonium can be directly uptaken by plant roots, which thermodynamically makes sense, although because in most soils aerobic conditions are preponderant, nitrate tends to be the ion uptaken most often. Soil bacteria in the aerobic zone of the soil will oxidize adsorbed ammonium into nitrate, which then becomes available for plant roots. The whole chain of events slows the release of inorganic nitrogen to crops and thus makes for more effective fertilizers. Health hazard No direct known health hazard back to top 5.1.6 Anoxic waters Anoxic waters are areas of sea water, fresh water, or groundwater that are depleted of dissolved oxygen and are a more severe condition of hypoxia (Wikipedia) Anoxic waters result from an IMBALANCE between oxygen supply and demand back to top 5.2 C 5.2.1 Carbon dioxide Carbon dioxide is a colorless gas which density is 50% higher than that of dry air. Formula: \\(CO_2\\) Carbon dioxide 3D shape: Lewis dot structure: Number of electron C has for itself following electronegativity rule: zero \\(CO_2\\) can only be an electron acceptor Production: oxidation of C in all organic molecules Almost all respiratory processes on earth (some respiration does not involve oxidation of C) Combustion of all Carbon-based fuel Consumption: Photosynthesis Atmospheric carbon dioxide is the primary carbon source for life on Earth Calcite precipitation in the oceans Ecological Significance: Greenhouse Gas, which serves as reference for all other GHG Concentration in the atmosphere ~380 ppm on the rise, or 0.38%, or a partial pressure of 0.38 atm Carbon Dioxide variations through ancient and modern times concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from hundreds of thousands of years ago through 2015, measured in parts per million (ppm). The data come from a variety of historical ice core studies and recent air monitoring sites around the world. Each line represents a different data source (EPA 2016) In reality, concentrations are not stable, and vary widely in time and in space at the next two videos nicely show. The next one results from the model simulations Youtube video of \\(CO_2\\) modeled seasonal variations - The following one is the combination of both models and observations Youtube video of \\(CO_2\\) modeled and observed seasonal variations back to top 5.2.2 Carbonates After carbon dioxide dissolves in water, it will combine with water to form carbonic acid (\\(H_2CO_3\\)). Carbonate serves as the carbon source for aquatic vegetation Carbonic acid can then dissociate into bicarbonate (\\(HCO_3^-\\)) and carbonate (\\(CO_3^{2-}\\)) \\[\\begin{align} H_2CO_3 &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; HCO_3^- + H^+ \\tag{5.2} \\\\ HCO_3^- &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; CO_3^{2-} + H^+ \\tag{5.3} \\end{align}\\] In an environment not open to the atmosphere (or where direct exchange with the atmosphere is very limited like in stream or wetland sediment), the preponderant form depends on the pH and can be calculated as illustrated on the graph below. In sea water, Carbonate can combine with \\(Ca^{2+}\\) to form Calcium Carbonate (\\(CaCO_3\\)), which precipitates out of solution. In other words, calcium carbonate formation is a sink for carbonate, and ultimately from \\(CO_2\\) addition from the atmosphere to to increased \\(CO_2\\) concentrations in the atmosphere. Carbonates are thus a great pH buffer in aquatic environments 5.2.3 Catabolism Reactions involving the breaking down of organic substrates, typically by oxidative breakdown, to provide chemically available energy (e.g. A TP) and/or to generate metabolic intermediates used in subsequent anabolic reactions (De Bolster 1997). Synonyms: Aerobic and anaerobic respirations which use organic molecules as electron donors, are synonyms of catabolism. In soil science another synonym of catabolism is mineralization, which refers to the decomposition or oxidation of the chemical compounds in organic matter releasing the nutrients contained in those compounds into soluble inorganic forms that may be plant-accessible (Wikipedia contributors 2018c). 5.3 D 5.3.1 Denitrification The microbially mediated dissimilatory reduction of nitrate into dinitrogen see denitrification in chapters for more details 5.3.2 Dihydrogen sulfide see hydrogen sulfide back to top 5.4 E 5.4.1 Eutrophication Definitions: ‘an increase in the rate of supply of organic matter to an ecosystem’ (Nixon 1995) ‘is the enrichment of a water body with nutrients, usually with an excess amount of nutrients’ (Wikipedia) ‘the enrichment of water by nutrients, especially nitrogen and/or phosphorus, causing an accelerated growth of algae and higher forms of plant life to produce an undesirable disturbance to the balance of organisms present in the water and to the quality of water concerned’ (Anonymous 1991b) ‘the enrichment of water by nitrogen compounds causing an accelerated growth of algae and higher forms of plant life to produce an undesirable disturbance to the balance of organisms present in the water and to the quality of water concerned’ (Anonymous 1991a) back to top 5.5 G 5.5.1 Greenhouse gases (GHG) A greenhouse gas is a gas in an atmosphere that absorbs and emits radiant energy within the thermal infrared range. This process is the fundamental cause of the greenhouse effect. The primary greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere are water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Without greenhouse gases, the average temperature of Earth’s surface would be about −18 °C (0 °F), rather than the present average of 15 °C (59 °F). In the Solar System, the atmospheres of Venus, Mars and Titan also contain gases that cause a greenhouse effect.

It is very poisonous, corrosive, flammable and acidic in nature.

Production: Hydrogen sulfide often results from the microbial breakdown, or mineralization, of organic matter in anaerobic conditions, such as may exist in swamps and sewers. When happening in sediment, this is referred to as sediment diagenesis Consumption: back to top 5.7 L 5.7.1 Lithotrophs Lithotrophs are a diverse group of organisms using inorganic substrate (usually of mineral origin) to obtain reducing equivalents for use in biosynthesis (e.g., carbon dioxide fixation) or energy conservation (i.e., ATP production) via aerobic or anaerobic respiration. Known chemolithotrophs are exclusively microorganisms.

The electrons are transferred from the carbon to the oxygen atoms following two redox half-reactions to obtain the overall reaction: \\[\\begin{align} CH_4 + 2\\,H_2O &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; CO_2 + 8\\,H^+ + 8\\,e^-\\\\ 2\\,O_2 + 8\\,H^+ + 8\\,e^- &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; 4\\,H_2O\\\\ &amp; &amp;\\\\ \\hline\\\\ CH_4 + 2\\,O_2 &amp; \\to &amp; CO_2 + 2\\,H_2O \\end{align}\\] Production: Consumption: Ecological significance: Concentrations of methane in the atmosphere from hundreds of thousands of years ago through 2015, measured in parts per billion (ppb).

In other words, for the pH of most natural waters (4.5 &lt; pH &lt; 8), \\(HNO_3\\) is totally insignificant. Production: from the complete oxidation of inorganic nitrogenous molecules which include ammonia, ammonium, nitrite from the mineralization and complete oxidation of amine radicals in organic molecules Consumption: Uptake from microbes, plants, and algae for their anabolism, which consists in building complex organic molecules from inorganic ones. Uptake, assimilation, anabolism, immobilization are all synonymous terms to express the fact that the N atom is immobilized, at least temporarily in organic molecules. Because N is assimilated in organic molecules during uptake/anabolism, and because N gains electrons in the process (it is thus reduced), we refer to nitrate uptake as assimilatory nitrate reduction. Denitrification: under anaerobic conditions, nitrate is used by facultative anaerobes as electron acceptor to generate ATP in their respiration chain. The two major end products of denitrification are gases, namely dinitrogen (\\(N_2\\)) and nitrous oxide (\\(N_2O\\)), which leave the aqueous environment. As such, nitrate is not assimilated by any bacteria and denitrification is therefore, as opposed to uptake, referred to as **dissimilatory nitrate reduction into dinitrogen (\\(N_2\\)) and nitrous oxide (\\(N_2O\\)). Ecological significance: Because of assimilation and denitrification processes, the overall nitrate concentrations in rivers tends to diminish from the catchment headwaters to the receiving bodies such as estuaries and coastal areas. As a result, inorganic nitrogen has naturally been in very short supply in these coastal water bodies, and nitrate and traditionally been the nutrient limiting aquatic productivity there. Very much like with phosphate, algae have adapted to be able to grow in very low concentrations. Anthropogenic activities, and agriculture in particular, have largely increased the loads and concentration of nitrate reaching estuaries, to the point where nitrate is no longer the limiting factor. As a result, excess nitrate is one of the reasons for the global and persistent presence of algal blooms in estuaries and coastal waters. Health hazard: There is a heated debate about the health hazard that nitrate might pose. Some argue that if anything, there might be beneficial effects, while others argue that there are evidence of cancers linked to excess nitrate absorption. Unfortunately, arguments on both sides might not be totally independent of militantism and lobbies. The only consensus everybody seems to agree upon is the Blue Baby syndrome, or methemoglobinemia. Methemoglobinemia is an unusual and potentially fatal condition in which hemoglobin is oxidized to methemoglobin and loses its ability to bind and transport oxygen, hence the cyanosis (blue appearance) usually visible on fingers, toes, and lips. Nitrate reduced to nitrite in the body of humans and animals enters the body stream where it seems to directly oxidize oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin-peroxide complex. Picture of a Blue Baby from syndromespedia.com/blue-baby-syndrome.html Drinking water standards Although there is still a heated debate whether or not nitrate does have have detrimental health effects, the World Health Organization has provided maximum concentration guidelines of 50 mg/L as nitrate (World Health Organization 2011). These guidelines have been enacted in hard laws in the US and in Europe. The 50 mg/L as nitrate equates 11.2 mg \\(NO_3\\)-N/L and in the US, the drinking water standard is 10 mg \\(NO_3\\)-N/L. back to top 5.9.2 Nitrous Oxide Commonly known as laughing gas Nitrous oxide has significant medical uses, especially in surgery and dentistry, for its anesthetic and pain reducing effects. Formula: \\(N_2O\\) Nitrous Oxide 3D shape: Number of electron N has for itself following electronegativity rule: the first one on the left has 5 the middle N has 3 \\(N_2O\\) can be both an electron acceptor and an electron donor Production: \\(N_2O\\) is produced due to bacterial processes (over 90%) and anthropogenic processes such as burning of fossil fuel The two main bacterial processes are nitrification and denitrification Accounting that human activities have enhanced both nitrification and denitrification processes, it is estimated that overall, about 2/3rd of \\(N_2O\\) production is natural, and about 1/3rd is human enhanced Consumption: Because of all the electrons stored on the two N atoms (5 + 3 = 8), nitrous oxide is a potential electron donor and bacteria can use it for their respiration processes Ecological significance: Powerful Greenhouse Gas, 298 times that of \\(CO_2\\) (EPA) Concentration in the atmosphere ~0.0003 ppm or ~325 ppb on the rise Concentrations of nitrous oxide in the atmosphere from hundreds of thousands of years ago through 2015, measured in parts per billion (ppb). The data come from a variety of historical ice core studies and recent air monitoring sites around the world. Each line represents a different data source)(EPA 2016) back to top 5.10 O 5.10.1 Oligotrophication ‘a decrease in the rate of supply of organic matter to an ecosystem’ (Nixon 2009) back to top 5.10.2 Oxidation Oxidation is the loss of electrons by a molecule, atom, or ion. The term oxidation was first used by Antoine Lavoisier to signify reaction of a substance with oxygen. Much later, it was realized that the substance, upon being oxidized, loses electrons, and the meaning was extended to include other reactions in which electrons are lost. back to top 5.10.3 Oxidation state The oxidation state (OS), or sometimes referred to as the oxidation number, quantifies the number of electrons that an atom has gained (expressed as negative charge value) or lost (expressed as positive charge value) compared to the number of valence electrons it has in its free form. As a result, it can be zero, positive or negative. For metal ions, the OS corresponds to its charge The change in oxidation state is a very powerful tool to understand the redox processes involved in the environement. But OS is less than ideal when comparing the absolute number of electrons one element has for itself For example, the nitrogen atom N, has 5 valence electrons. In the dinitrogen molecule N2, the Lewis dot structure suggests that each atom share 3 electrons with the other but essentially have 5 electrons for themselves as in Figure 5.1 Figure 5.1: Electron allocation on each of the N atom for the dinitrogen molecule N2 As a result, the number of electron on each atom equals the number of valence electrons on the free form of N, hence OS = 0. Now in the nitrous oxide case in Figure 5.2, the nitrogen atom to the left OS = 0, but for the middle Nitrogen atom, OS = -2, as two electrons were stripped by oxygen. Figure 5.2: Electron allocation on each of the N atom for the N2O molecule The problem with the oxidation state indicator is that it is a relative number, and not absolute. The electron allocation indicator that quantifies the number of electrons each atom has for itself is more abolute and thus comparable. For example, the inorganic molecule with one C atom stable in an oxidized environment is CO2, the inorganic molecule with one N atom stable in an oxidized environment is \\(NO_3^-\\), and the inorganic molecule with one S atom stable in an oxidized environment is \\(SO_4^{2-}\\). All three atoms have zero electrons for themselves as oxygen has ‘stolen’ them (Figure 5.3). So they are all potential electron acceptors that can accept up to 8 electrons. In a way they are very similar. Figure 5.3: Electron allocation on each of the C, N, and S atom for the CO2, nitrate and sulfate molecules But if one calculates the oxidation states for each of the C, N, and S atoms, for these three molecules, one would find OSC = -4, OSN = -5, and OSS = -6… We believe this can be very confusing and prefer to use the electron allocation concept as a more absolute indicator. back to top 5.11 P 5.11.1 Phosphate Phosphate is an inorganic chemical and a salt-forming anion of phosphoric acid Formula: \\(PO_4^{3-}\\) Phosphate is one of the anions of the polyprotic acid (i.e., which can liberate several protons \\(H^{+}\\)) The conjugate bases of phosphate are: All conjugate bases are related through the set acid-base chemical equilibria: \\[\\begin{align} H_3PO_4 &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; H_2PO_4^- + H^+ \\tag{$pK_A$ = 2.12}\\\\ H_2PO_4^- &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; HPO_4^{2-} + H^+ \\tag{$pK_A$ = 7.21}\\\\ HPO_4^{2-}&amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; PO_4^{3-} + H^+ \\tag{$pK_A$ = 12.67} \\end{align}\\] The preponderant form of phosphate in a solution also depends on the pH following this relationship: Production: Phosphorus in general and phosphate in practice has remained one of the nutrients limiting the most plant productivity on our planet Phosphates are the naturally occurring form of the element phosphorus, found in many phosphate minerals Phosphate minerals are mined to obtain phosphorus for use in agriculture and industry The largest global producer and exporter of phosphates is Morocco. Within North America, the largest deposits lie in the Bone Valley region of central Florida, the Soda Springs region of southeastern Idaho, and the coast of North Carolina (near Aurora). Consumption: Uptake from all primary producer including plants and algae Phosphate can also be immobilized by bacteria In food industry, phosphates help baked goods rise, they act as emulsifiers in processed cheese and canned soup, they add flavor to cola and color to frozen french fries. They also can be added to meat, poultry and seafood to help the protein bind more water, making it juicier after freezing and reheating. Ecological significance: Phosphorus as phosphate naturally is the most limiting factor for primary productivity for land and aquatic plants. Because it tends to bind to particles, phosphates have accumulated with sediment particularly in coastal areas, where phosphate can become available again to algae through sediment diagenetic processes. As a result, phosphate is generally not considered the most limiting factor for algae in estuaries and coastal environment. However, it does tend to be the limiting nutrient in freshwater receiving bodies such as lakes and reservoirs. Excess phosphate in freshwater receiving bodies has been shown to be the nutrient causing some major eutrophication problems throughout the planet back to top 5.12 R 5.12.1 Reactive nitrogen back to top 5.12.2 Redox Redox (short for reduction–oxidation reaction) is a chemical reaction in which the oxidation states of atoms are changed. Any such reaction involves both a reduction process and a complementary oxidation process, effectively allowing the electron transfer processes. 5.12.3 Redox couple redox couples, commonly noted as ‘Ox/Red’ refer to the two forms that an element might take depending on its oxidation state Ox in ‘Ox/Red’ refers to as the oxidizer or oxidizing agent, as it has the capability to make other elements lose their electrons. Red in ‘Ox/Red’ refers to as the reducer or reducing agent, as it has the capability to give electrons to other elements Common redox couples which matter in environmental and ecological engineering include: CO2/CH2O O2/H2O NO3-/N2 NO3-/NH4+ NO3-/NO2- MnO2/Mn2+ Fe3+/Fe2+ SO42-/H2S CO2/CH4 5.12.4 Redox half-reactions A half reaction is either the oxidation or reduction reaction component of a redox reaction. A half reaction is obtained by considering the change in oxidation states of individual substances involved in the redox reaction (Wikipedia contributors 2018a) Redox half reactions illustrate the transfer of electrons from the oxidized form of an element to a reduced form of an element. Half-reactions are often used as a method of balancing redox reactions To derive half-reactions, the first convention is that the oxidizer is on the left of the equation, and the reducer on the right one must first equilibrate all elements other than O and H then one balances for O, by adding H2O on the appropriate side of the half reaction then one add the appropriate number of H+ to balance the H Finally one adds the appropriate number of e- to balance the charge. The number of e- must correspond to the change in oxidation state The half-reactions corresponding to the redox couples above are: CO2/CH2O \\[\\begin{equation} CO_2 + 4 H^+ + 4 e^- \\rightarrow CH_2O + H_2O \\end{equation}\\] CH2O here is a generic formula to represent the electron donating capacity of OM. This equation might be misleading as it corresponds to the OM donating 4 electrons in the respiration schemes, but because it is written using the ox/red convention, is the opposite of the intuitive direction. So a more intuitive half-reaction might be, and is effectively what is used to write the full redox reaction: \\[\\begin{equation} CH_2O + H_2O \\rightarrow CO_2 + 4 H^+ + 4 e^- \\end{equation}\\] O2/H2O \\[\\begin{equation} O_2 + 4 H^+ + 4 e^- \\rightarrow 4H_2O \\end{equation}\\] NO3-/N2 \\[\\begin{equation} 2 NO_3^- + 10 e^- + 12 H^+ \\rightarrow N_2 + 6 H_2O \\end{equation}\\] MnO2/Mn2+ \\[\\begin{equation} MnO_2 + 4 e^- + 4 H^+ \\rightarrow Mn^{2+} + 2 H_2O \\end{equation}\\] Fe3+/Fe2+ \\[\\begin{equation} Fe^{3+} + 1 e^- \\rightarrow Fe^{2+} \\\\ \\end{equation}\\] SO42-/H2S \\[\\begin{equation} SO_4^{2-} + 8 e^- + 10 H^+ \\rightarrow H_2S + 4 H_2O \\end{equation}\\] CO2/CH4 \\[\\begin{equation} CO_2 + 8 e^- + 8 H^+ \\rightarrow CH_4 + 2 H_2O \\end{equation}\\] a redox reaction always involves two half reactions where the electrons are transfered from the lowest redox potential couple to the highest redox potential couple. For example, the combustion of methane in oxygen involves the two O2/H2O and CO2/CH4 couples. The half-reaction of the highest redox potential couple goes on top, and that of the lowest potential at the bottom, but this time written as red/ox like in the equation below: \\[\\begin{align} 2\\,O_2 + 8\\,H^+ + 8\\,e^- &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; 4\\,H_2O\\\\ CH_4 + 2\\,H_2O &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; CO_2 + 8\\,H^+ + 8\\,e^-\\\\ &amp; &amp;\\\\ \\hline\\\\ CH_4 + 2\\,O_2 &amp; \\to &amp; CO_2 + 2\\,H_2O \\end{align}\\] 5.12.5 Reduction Reduction is the gain of electrons by a molecule, atom, or ion. back to top 5.13 S 5.13.1 Sulfate Sulfate is the inorganic sulfur anion stable in oxidized water Formula: \\(SO_4^{2-}\\) Sulfate 3D shape: Lewis dot structure of nitrate: Number of electron S has for itself following electronegativity rule: zero \\(SO_4^{2-}\\) can only be an electron acceptor \\(SO_4^{2-}\\) is the conjugate base of Hydrogen sulfate \\(HSO_4^{-}\\). The figure below shows that for pH normally measured in surface water and streams (4.5-8), \\(SO_4^{2-}\\) is the truly preponderant form. We therefore generally omit to mention \\(HSO_4^{-}\\) as a chemical form that plays any significant role. During their anabolism, primary producers uptake sulfate, but the sulfur atoms can be incorporated into amino-acids only after sulfur has been reduced, or gained 8 electrons to be in a thiol (\\(-SH\\)) form.

In reality, at night, phototrophs become chemotrophs as their cellular respiration is based upon oxidizing organic matter. But they are autosufficient. They capture solar energy and store it in a chemical form thanks to photosynthesis, and used that stored energy later on. Just about all green plants are phototrophs. Chemotrophs Chemotrophs obtain their energy as energy previously stored in a chemical form. Just about all pluricellular organisms are chemotrophs, even the phototrophs, which turn into chemotrophs at night References "],
