# Preface {-}

This is the first attempt at a textbook for BAE 204. It will be updated as class proceeds. 

```{r include=FALSE}

## Author {-}

[François Birgand](https://francoisbirgand.github.io) is an Associate Professor and [University Faculty Scholar](https://provost.ncsu.edu/strategic-initiatives/university-faculty-scholars/) of biogeochemistry and ecological engineering in the department of [Biological and Agricultural Engineering](https://www.bae.ncsu.edu/) at North Carolina State University, in Raleigh, NC, USA. His research interests aim to provide solutions to improve the quality of water in streams and rivers. Practically, his research focuses on improving the treatment efficiency of streams, wetlands, soils or wood chip bioreactors. Much of this research is based upon principles this textbook is trying to provide for students of all ages.
